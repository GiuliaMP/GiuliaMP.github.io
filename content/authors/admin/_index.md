Hello there! I am a Ph.D. student at the Real-Time Systems (ReTiS) Laboratory, Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna in Pisa. I previously completed my Master’s degree in Data Science and scientific computing at the University of Trieste and held a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Rome, La Sapienza. My research focuses on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and enhancing RL agents’ decision-making abilities in novel situations. I also believe that drawing inspiration from diverse domains is crucial for getting fresh perspectives.

In my spare time, I love exploring how AI algorithms can be used to enhance video game development. When I am not at the computer, I enjoy exploring the outdoors through hiking and horse riding. Additionally, I love traveling and learning more about different languages, and cultures.

Do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to connect.

Thank you for visiting!
