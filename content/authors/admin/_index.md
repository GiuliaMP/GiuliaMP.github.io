I am a recent graduate of the Data Science and Scientific Computing MSc program at the University of Trieste, with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Sapienza, University of Rome. My passion for technology and science led me to specialize in Artificial Intelligence (AI). I'm particularly interested in exploring the intersection of AI and neuroscience, and I'm excited to deepen my knowledge in Reinforcement Learning.

In my free time, I love discovering how AI can be applied to videogames and exploring the different ways in which AI algorithms can be used to create engaging gaming experiences.

When I'm not at the computer, I enjoy exploring the outdoors through hiking and horse riding. I also have a passion for traveling and learning about new cultures and languages.

Feel free to explore my site and get to know me better. Do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to connect. 

Thank you for visiting!
